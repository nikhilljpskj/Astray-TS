<h1 style="color: #45b6fe">Privacy Policy</h1><br><br><br>






<h4 style="color: #ffffff">Effective 15 July 2021</h4><br><br>

<h5 style="color: #ffffff">Astray, respects and values its Users’ privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the information Astray collects from Users when they visit Astray (the “Website”), how Astray uses that information, and under what circumstances Astray may or does disclose that information. This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with the Astray Terms of Service also available on the Website.</h5><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Changes to Privacy Policies.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">Astray's Privacy Policy is subject to change from time to time, so Astray suggests that User reviews the current Privacy Policy at the start of each visit to the Website. Unless Astray clearly expresses otherwise, Astray will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which User Information, as defined below, was collected, and User accepts and agrees to Astray practices as described herein. USER IS HEREBY ADVISED THAT USER’S CONTINUED USE OF THE WEBSITE CONSTITUTES USER’S ACCEPTANCE OF ANY AMENDMENTS TO AND THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE WEBSITE’S TERMS OF SERVICE.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Information Astray Collects.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">When User uses the Website, Astray may receive and collect certain information. The information that Astray may receive and collect depends on what User does when it visits the Website.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Automatically Collected Information.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">Some information is automatically received and sometimes collected from User when User visits the Website. This information may include some or all of the following items: (i) the name of the domain and host from which User accesses the Internet, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer User is using and the IP address of User’s Internet Service Provider; (ii) the type and version of Internet browser software User uses and its operating system; (iii) the date and time User accesses the Website, the length of User’s stay and the specific pages, images, video or forms that User accesses while visiting the site; (iv) the Internet address of the website from which User linked directly to the Website, and if applicable, the search engine that referred User and any search strings or phrases that User entered into the search engine to find the Website; and (v) demographic information concerning the country of origin of User’s computer and the language(s) used by it. Astray uses this information to monitor the usage of the Website, assess its performance, ensure technological compatibility with Users’ computers, and understand the relative importance of the information provided on the Website. Astray may also use this data to conduct statistical analyses on Users’ usage patterns and other aggregated data.</p>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Information Collected via Cookies.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">“Cookies” are small files or records that are placed on User’s computer to distinguish User from other visitors to the Website. The use of cookies is a standard practice among websites to collect or track information about User’s activities while using the Website. Generally, a Cookie may enable a website owner to track how a visitor navigates through the website and the areas in which visitors show interest. This is analogous to a traffic report: it tracks trends and behaviors but does not identify individuals. Information gathered in this fashion may include date and time of visits, pages viewed, time spent at the Website, and the website visited just before and just after a visit to the Website. Cookies can be set to expire: (i) on a specified date; (ii) after a specific period of time; (iii) when a transaction has been completed; or (iv) when a User turns off his/her Internet browser. A Cookie that is erased from memory when a visitor’s Internet browser closes is called a “session” cookie whereas Cookies which expire based on a time set by the Web server are called “persistent” cookies. The Website may use both “session cookies” and “permanent cookies,” as well as session tracking technology (e.g., InspectLet) which analyzes user behavior when on the Website. Internet browsers are typically set to accept Cookies by default. User can choose to have its browser warn User every time a Cookie is being sent to User or User can turn off Cookie placements. If User refuses Cookies, there may be parts of the Website which may not function properly.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Information User May Actively Submit Through the Website.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">For some of the browsing on the Website, Astray neither requires nor collects “User Information,” which is information communicated by User to Astray generally for use by Astray in contacting User, e.g., User’s name and email address. User can browse the Website and take as much time as User wants to review the Website without having to submit such User Information. In the following instances, however and without limitation, User will be required to submit User Information: (i) when User wants to contact Astray via email or Website contact forms; (ii) when User registers an account on the Website; or (iii) as necessary to process transactions entered into via the Website. E-mail or other forms of electronic communication, including contact form submission, are inherently not a secure and/or confidential means of communication. Information that is provided to Astray as a “Submission,” as that term is used in the Website Terms of Services, is not “User Information” as that term is used in this Privacy Policy, and Astray may handle Submission information in its sole discretion.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Personal Information About Children.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">The Website is targeted primarily for use by adults. Astray does not target or create special areas for use by children. Accordingly, Astray does not knowingly collect age identifying information, nor does Astray knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 years. HOWEVER, ASTRAY HEREBY ADVISES ALL VISITORS TO THE WEBSITE UNDER THE AGE OF 13 NOT TO DISCLOSE OR PROVIDE ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ON THE WEBSITE. In the event that Astray discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to Astray, in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (please see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.onguardonline.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online for more information about this Act. Astray will delete the child’s personally identifiable information from Astray's files to the extent possible.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">E-Mail Communication.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">When User sends an email to Astray or provides User’s email address to Astray, User is communicating with Astray electronically and consents to receive communication from Astray electronically. Astray may retain the content of such email(s), User’s email address, and Astray response(s) in order to further service User’s needs. Astray may use the data that User provides to send User email or correspondence via other means.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">How Astray Uses and Shares User Information.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">Astray may use User Information that User actively submits to better assist User when User visits or contact Astray again and to send User special offers which may be of interest to User. Astray may do this by general marketing communications for the Website or related services, including by e-mail, (collectively, “Marketing Communications”). Unless User “opts-out” through opportunities available to User through Astray's Marketing Communications, Astray may send User Marketing Communications. User may also “opt-out” of future Marketing Communications by following the instructions provided in this Privacy Policy under the “Access to and Managing User Information” section of this Privacy Policy. Except where Astray otherwise obtains User’s express permission, Astray may share User Information with third-parties only under the limited circumstances stated below:

Information is subject to disclosure in response to judicial or other governmental subpoenas, warrants, and court orders served on Astray in accordance with their terms, as otherwise required by applicable law, or in response to requests by law enforcement.

Information is subject to disclosure to protect Astray's rights or property, protect its legitimate business interests, to enforce the provisions of Astray's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, and/or to prevent harm to User or others.

Information may be disclosed to: (i) carefully selected third-party service providers so that they may provide services to User; (ii) provide customer service; (iii) send or email Marketing Communications; (iv) maintain Astray’s promotions, database, and other programs; (v) monitor the activity of the Website; (vi) conduct surveys; and (vii) process transactions.

Information may be disclosed and transferred if Astray or its business is sold or offered for sale to another company or person(s), if a petition for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Laws is filed by or against us, or if Astray becomes subject to an order of appointment of a trustee or receiver.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Linking to Third-Party Websites.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">When User click on links on the Website that take User to third-party websites, User may be subject to the third-party website’s privacy policies. While Astray supports the protection of privacy on the Internet, Astray cannot be responsible for the actions of any third-party websites. Astray encourages User to read the posted privacy policies of any and every website User visits, whether User is linking from the Website or browsing on its own.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Access to and Managing User Information.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">Astray believes it is important for User to be able to: (i) find out what Information User has provided to Astray through the Website; (ii) update User Information; and (iii) “opt out” of receiving future Astray Communications. To inquire about User Information, update User Information, or “opt” out of receiving future Astray Communications, User may do one of the following:

Select the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” option(s) contained with Astray’s emails; or
Send an e-mail with User’s request and current contact information to astraysummarizer@gmail.com. If User sends an e-mail request, User should include its full name and email address, and indicate the specific nature of User’s request. If User wants to “opt in” or “opt out” of receiving Astray communications, specifically what type of Astray communication (e.g., e-mail) User wishes to receive or stop receiving. This will ensure Astray identifies User correctly in Astray’s systems and accurately processes User’s request. Astray will take appropriate steps to implement User’s request, but due to production, mailing and system timelines, it may take up to ten (10) business days for e-mails. Until that change takes effect, User may still receive or not receive Astray Communications. “Opting-out” of Astray Communications may prevent Astray from providing certain services which may be necessary for User’s use of the Website or services provided thereon.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">What User Needs to Do to Protect its Information.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">User has several options when deciding how it can best protect User Information. One option is simply not to volunteer it. As stated above, this approach would allow User to still visit the Website, although it will prevent User, for example, from utilizing services or materials provided via the Website or providing Astray with User’s comments or questions relating to the Website. The Federal Trade Commission’s website, www.ftc.gov, also offers useful information about how to protect personally identifiable information provided to a website.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">What to Do About Suspected Violations of This Privacy Statement.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">If at any time User believes that Astray has not adhered to the policies and principles set forth in this Privacy Statement, please notify Astray using the contact information provided in Section 7(b). Astray will make all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly respond to such concerns.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Do-Not-Track.</h4>
<p style="color: #ffffff">To the extent do-not-track implementations from User’s browser(s) prevent or impede the delivery of services provided through Astray.com, those do-not-track implementations are not honored.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Questions or Comments.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">If User have any questions or comments concerning Astray’s Privacy Policy, please contact Astray using the information provided in Section 7(b).</p><br>
